this is yet another attempt to write a guide to ease a newbie into tft.

basic rules tldr:

- 8 players make board of characters. players board randomly fight each other. loser eat hp damage. die when hp reach 0.
- characters can buy from shop. characters got 5 tiers: greys are 1cost, green is 2cost, blue is 3cost, purple is 4cost, gold is 5cost. characters share a common pool (in general)
- combine 3 same characters to increase their 'stars'. eg finding 3 1* 1-cost will combine into 1 2* 1-cost. finding 3 2* 1-cost will combine into 1 3* 1-cost.
- shop provides 5 random characters from existing pool. can spend 2 gold to reroll (i.e. gacha). there are gacha rates (eg 40% to roll a tier 1, 20% to roll tier 2, etc). 
- you can spend 4 gold to buy 4 exp. exp is used to level up. the higher the level, the better your gacha rates to find higher cost units and the more units you can place.
- you gain 5 gold per fight. +1 more if you win. you also gain +2 exp.
- every 10 gold you own, you get +1 interest up to +5 per fight. (eg. holding 10 gold gives you 1 extra gold). very impt.
- 1 stage consist of 3 player rounds -> 1 carosell round -> 3 player round -> 1 npc round (except for stage 1 which is 3 npc rounds). 
- diff characters have diff traits. traits give diff bonus. some good, some bad, some buggy. use your feeling and share with everyone <3
- at stages 2-1, 3-2 and 4-2, you will get augments to select. some good, some bad, some buggy. use your feeling and share with everyone <3
- there are items. items got 4 kinds: components, radiants, artifact, support and completed. 2 components can form one completed item. the rest are 'full' items that have their own effect that we have to just memorize. also, some good, some bad, some buggy hehe
