# MOMOREPO 

## What this?

This is the monorepo of all my minimal C/C++ projects written from scratch with the help of as little libraries as possible. The code here contains: 

* Momo Library: my personal C/C++ library.
* Eden: my personal C/C++ game engine.
* Getuna: a screenshot tool.
* LIT: a game about lighting.
* Advent of Code solutions.
* Assembly practice snippets
